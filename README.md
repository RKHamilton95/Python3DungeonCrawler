Text Based Dungeon Crawler written in Python 3

Project Proposal 

Text-Based Dungeon Crawler 

By: Ryan Hamilton, Ben Eckert 

For our project we would like to build a text-based dungeon crawler game. This will show Python’s efficacy with object-oriented programming by featuring player, enemy, and item objects. The project will also demonstrate python’s recursive functionalities through the procedural generation of mazes for the player to traverse. 

Project Plan: 

| Week  | Program Step |
| ------------- | ------------- |
October 29th - November 4th | Create Player, Enemy and Item Objects 
November 5th - November 11th | Create Recursive Maze Ensure its passable 
November 12th - November 18th | Add user input to create character and move through the maze 
November 19th - November 25th | Add “save” system through csv file handling 
November 26th - December 2nd | Battle system, loot system, bug-fixes, misc. 
December 3rd - December 7th | Program Complete Ready to Present
